Report on ApJ/341471/ART<br>
&quot;First, Second and Third Massive Stars in Open Clusters&quot;<br>
by A. Mints<br>
<br>
The paper describes an interesting method to determine the total mass<br>
and number of stars of a star cluster by using only the most-massive<br>
stars. This is done for three different methods of sampling stars from<br>
the IMF as well as for different values which describe the distribution<br>
of n-th most-massive star, the mean, median and mode. Easy to apply<br>
formulae to obtain the total cluster mass and number of stars by only<br>
using the 1st, 2nd or 3rd massive star in the cluster are derived for<br>
the different cases and their errors are evaluated by comparing with <br>
numerical Monte Carlo experiments.<br>
<br>
However, I cannot recommend publication of the work before significant<br>
changes, improvements or clarifications are made. <br>
<br>
<br>
1) In the introduction, the dynamical mass estimation of star clusters<br>
through the virial theorem is briefly mentioned. I think it would help<br>
the cause of the paper to point out that besides the larger amount of<br>
observational data required to do so, such dynamical masses also suffer<br>
from the usually unknown binary properties of the cluster members<br>
(Kouwenhoven &amp; de Grijs, 2009, Ap&amp;SS, 324, 171).<br>
The introduction should also mentioned the &quot;photometric&quot; approach to<br>
determine cluster masses - transformation of the magnitudes and colors<br>
of suspected member stars via evolutionary models and then integration<br>
of the derived mass function with or without extrapolation beyond the<br>
observational lower limit.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Again only briefly mentioned in the introduction is the proposed<br>
relation between the cluster mass and the most-massive star in a<br>
cluster by Weidner &amp; Kroupa (2006). Here it should be pointed out that<br>
Maschberger &amp; Clarke (2008) actually argue against such a relation and<br>
that while Weidner, Kroupa &amp; Bonnell (2010, MNRAS, 401, 275)<br>
re-investigate this issue, the existence of a physical correlation<br>
rather than a statistical one is not beyond doubt. <br>
As the author propagates the use of the median or the mode of the<br>
distribution of the n-th most-massive star rather than the average, it<br>
might be of use to note that Weidner, Kroupa &amp; Bonnell (2010) also<br>
discuss this topic but for the most-massive star alone.<br>
<br>
<br>
3) Still in the introduction, the author tells us that he is going to<br>
neglect stellar binarity and evolution. Here my main concern is a<br>
third important factor: dynamical ejections of massive stars (see for<br>
example Pflamm-Altenburg &amp; Kroupa, 2006, MNRAS, 373, 295 and<br>
Schillbach &amp; Roeser, 2008, A&amp;A, 489, 105). The ejection of the<br>
most-massive star might be unlikely because in triple interactions<br>
usually the least-massive star is ejected, but as O stars are often in<br>
binaries with other O stars (e.g. Sana et al. 2009, MNRAS, 400, 1479<br>
and Sana et al. 2008, MNRAS, 386, 447), which tend to group in the<br>
core of young clusters (e.g. Kerber &amp; Santiago, 2006, A&amp;A, 452, 155),<br>
the dynamical loss of the 2nd or 3rd massive star might be much more<br>
common.<br>
How much would such an event change the results of this analysis? <br>
Is there any way to estimate the error if the 2nd or 3rd massive stars is<br>
ejected? <br>
This might also give an error estimate for unresolved binaries. If,<br>
e.g., the 2nd and 3rd massive star are in a close orbit, they might<br>
&quot;look&quot; like the most-massive star and henceforth, the actually<br>
most-massive one is used as the 2nd massive one.<br>
<br>
<br>
4) Generally, I also miss a broader discussion of the relevant<br>
literature in the introduction. For example, Elmegreen (2000, ApJ, 539,<br>
342) shows how the cluster mass should scale with the mass of the<br>
most-massive star (M_cl ~ 3 10^3 (m_max/100)^1.35) when no limit for<br>
the IMF is assumed. Such a result should be compared with authors new<br>
findings.<br>
<br>
<br>
5) The definition of the so-called &quot;sorted sampling&quot; at the beginning<br>
of Section 2 differs somewhat from the sorted sampling in Weidner &amp;<br>
Kroupa (2006) (WK06). WK06 take a number of stars, calculated by<br>
dividing a given cluster mass by the mean of the used IMF, randomly<br>
from the IMF, sorted them by mass and add them up starting with the<br>
lowest mass star. If this does not reach the given cluster mass, the<br>
difference is again divided by the mean from the IMF and this<br>
additional number of stars is randomly taken from the IMF. Then all<br>
stars are again sorted by mass and summed up. If necessary, this is<br>
repeated until the cluster mass is reached.<br>
It is not clear to me, if the author proceeded in the same way or<br>
not. This should be clarified.<br>
<br>
<br>
6) In his results Section (4) mass and number estimator functions<br>
based on the average and median and mode values are defined. But Tab.1<br>
only gives the fit formula parameters for the average and median<br>
values but not for the mode. But in Tab.2 and 3 the errors and<br>
dispersion are given for the mode as well. The fit parameters for the<br>
mode should be added to Tab.1.<br>
<br>
<br>
7) On page 9 (Section 4.1) the errors shown in Tab.2 and 3 are<br>
discussed. Here I do not fully understand the numbers given in the<br>
text when compared to the tables. When using the average estimator<br>
errors up to 40% are given on page 9 but in Tab.2 the largest error I<br>
see is 23.24%. Why?<br>
For the median estimator, it is quoted that the error is always less than 3%<br>
which is true, but I find that they are always less than 2% in Tab.2. <br>
The mode estimator values of Tab.2 are not discussed at all but, at<br>
least according to Tab.2, it quite often has larger errors than the<br>
average estimator.<br>
In contrast to this in Tab.3, the mode estimator gives always by far the lowest<br>
dispersion, while the average estimator can result in extremely large<br>
dispersions.<br>
Therefore, Tables 2 and 3 need to be discussed in more detail.<br>
<br>
<br>
8) Section 4.4 discusses the estimator reliability. It is noted that<br>
the calculated differences for different sampling methods and 1st, 2nd<br>
and 3rd massive star, as shown in Tab.4, remain large but this result<br>
is not discussed at all. Why?<br>
Especially notable for me was the generally huge difference (50 to<br>
70%) when using the mode estimator for the 2nd and 3rd massive<br>
star. This needs to be discussed in that section.<br>
The last two paragraphs of Section 4.4 address a second reliability<br>
check - applying the estimators to the &quot;wrong&quot; dataset. Unfortunately,<br>
the results of this check are only summarized in the paper but not<br>
shown in detail. Maybe it is possible to add them as an additional<br>
column in Tab.4.<br>
<br>
<br>
9) The conclusions (Section 5) state that the median or the mode<br>
estimators are better than the average estimator. While I agree on the<br>
median estimator when looking at the tables 2 and 4, I do not see why<br>
the mode is supposed to be a &quot;good&quot; one. Only Tab.3 might support this<br>
conclusion. In general the results of the mode estimator are not well<br>
discussed in the paper at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
10) The English of the paper clearly needs improvement. Sentences like<br>
&quot;Using median values minimizes error for highest fraction of the data,<br>
while for the small fraction errors remain large&quot; are not easy to<br>
understand.<br>
It would also be helpful if the figures would be larger (especially<br>
Fig.1 and 3). It is nearly impossible to differentiate solid,<br>
long-dashed and short-dashed lines in Fig.3.<br>
Additionally, several of the references in the text have a strange<br>
format, for example &quot;Maschberger &amp; Clarke Maschberger &amp; Clarke<br>
(2008)&quot;. This needs to be fixed.
